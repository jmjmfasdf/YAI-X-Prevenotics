gastritis,위염,"위장조영검사 결과 위염이 의심됩니다. 위염은 여러 가지 원인에 의해 위점막에 염증이 발생한 것으로 속쓰림, 소화 불량 등 증상이 있으시면 진료를 받으시고, 특별한 증상이 없으시면 2년 후 정기검사를 받으시길 바랍니다.","Gastritis is a condition where the lining of your stomach becomes irritated or inflamed. Think of the stomach lining as a protective layer that shields your stomach from acids and other substances. When this layer gets damaged or irritated, it can lead to discomfort or pain in the stomach.","The common causes of gastritis include several factors. One of the main causes is an infection by a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which can harm the stomach lining. Another cause is the overuse of certain pain-relieving medications like aspirin or ibuprofen, which can irritate the stomach over time. Drinking too much alcohol can also weaken and inflame the stomach lining. Additionally, severe stress, such as that caused by surgery or injury, can trigger gastritis. In some cases, autoimmune conditions, where the body mistakenly attacks its own stomach cells, can lead to this condition.","The symptoms of gastritis can vary from person to person, but common signs include stomach pain or discomfort, usually in the upper abdomen. Some people might feel nausea or even vomit. Bloating, where the stomach feels full after eating very little, is another frequent symptom. Indigestion, often felt as a burning sensation or an upset stomach, can occur as well. In more severe cases, a person might vomit blood or notice their stools turning black, which could be a sign of bleeding in the stomach.","When it comes to treating gastritis, it depends on the underlying cause. If the irritation is due to excess stomach acid, medications like antacids can be used to neutralize the acid, providing relief from discomfort. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers may be prescribed to reduce the amount of acid the stomach produces, which can help heal the stomach lining. If the cause of gastritis is an infection by H. pylori bacteria, antibiotics will be necessary to clear the infection and allow the stomach to heal. If there are no specific symptoms, you need to have a routine gastroscopy in two years."

Think of the stomach lining as a protective layer that shields your stomach from acids and other substances. When this layer gets damaged or irritated, it can lead to discomfort or pain in the stomach.","The common causes of severe gastritis include an acute infection by the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, other bacterial or fungal infections, and irritants like alcohol, certain medications such as aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or even strong acids or alkalis which can harm the stomach lining. Chronic forms of gastritis can be due to ongoing issues such as persistent Helicobacter pylori infection, long-term medication use, smoking, or bile reflux.","If you're suffering from severe gastritis, you might experience symptoms like sudden, sharp pain in your upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting. In chronic cases, the symptoms could be more subdued and include indigestion, a feeling of fullness after eating only a small amount, bloating, and a quick sensation of being full, alongside nausea and heartburn.","The treatment of severe gastritis typically involves medication to reduce and manage the stomach acid, thereby giving your stomach lining a chance to heal. This might include proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers which decrease the acid production. Additionally, if an infection like Helicobacter pylori is present, antibiotics may be prescribed to clear the infection. Regular monitoring through endoscopic examinations is recommended, especially if conditions like chronic atrophic gastritis or hyperplastic gastritis are detected, as these can raise the risk of developing stomach cancer."
"chronic atrophic gastritis, mild","위축성위염, mild","위내시경 검사에서 만성위축성위염이 관찰됩니다. 위축성위염은 만성적인 염증과 노화에 의하여 위점막이 얇아진 상태입니다. 2년 후 정기 위 내시경검사를 권합니다. 흡연하고 있으시다면 꼭 금연하시고, 과음을 삼가십시오. 위에 자극이 되는 짠 음식과 탄 음식을 삼가시는 것이 위염 예방에 도움이 됩니다.","Chronic atrophic gastritis is a condition where the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed over a long period of time, leading to the loss of stomach cells that produce important digestive substances, such as acid and enzymes. Over time, this thinning of the stomach lining makes it harder for the stomach to function properly and absorb nutrients like vitamin B12. The term ""atrophic"" refers to the fact that the stomach tissue becomes thinner and weaker.","The main causes of chronic atrophic gastritis include an ongoing infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that can live in the mucous layer of the stomach. Other causes may include long-term use of irritating medications like aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic bile reflux, which can occur from irregular eating habits or after certain types of stomach surgery.","People with chronic atrophic gastritis might experience a variety of symptoms. These can include stomach discomfort or pain, particularly in the upper abdomen, and feelings of nausea. Some individuals may have indigestion or feel bloated after eating even small amounts of food. Because the stomach struggles to absorb nutrients, deficiencies in important vitamins like B12 can develop, which can cause fatigue, weakness, or symptoms of anemia. In some cases, chronic atrophic gastritis may not cause noticeable symptoms until the condition has progressed significantly.","The treatment for chronic atrophic gastritis depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is related to an H. pylori infection, antibiotics are usually prescribed to eliminate the bacteria and stop further damage to the stomach lining. In cases where the condition is autoimmune in nature, treatment may focus on managing symptoms and complications, such as vitamin B12 deficiency, which can be treated with supplements or injections. Medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers can help reduce stomach acid, allowing the stomach lining to heal and providing relief from discomfort.

intestinal metaplasia,장상피화생,"위내시경 검사에서 장상피화생이 관찰됩니다. 장상피화생은 위염이 진행되어 위점막이 울퉁불퉁하게 장점막화되는 상태입니다. 장상피화생이 있는 경우 위암 발생 가능성이 증가할 수 있으므로 1년 후 정기적인 위내시경검사를 권합니다. 흡연하고 있으시다면 꼭 금연하시고, 과음을 삼가십시오. 위에 자극이 되는 짠 음식과 탄 음식을 삼가시는 것이 위암 예방에 도움이 됩니다.","Intestinal metaplasia is a condition where the cells lining your stomach change and start to resemble the cells that are normally found in the intestines. This change happens as a response to chronic irritation or inflammation in the stomach. While this isn't cancer, intestinal metaplasia is considered a precancerous condition because, over time, it can increase the risk of developing stomach cancer if left untreated.","The most common cause of intestinal metaplasia is a long-term infection by Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a bacteria that damages the stomach lining and leads to inflammation. Another cause can be long-term acid reflux or chronic gastritis, where the stomach lining is repeatedly irritated. In some cases, lifestyle factors like smoking and a poor diet may contribute to the development of this condition.","Many people with intestinal metaplasia may not notice any specific symptoms. However, if the condition is linked to chronic inflammation or gastritis, symptoms like stomach pain, nausea, bloating, and indigestion can occur. In most cases, intestinal metaplasia is discovered when a doctor is investigating other stomach issues.","Treatment for intestinal metaplasia focuses on addressing the underlying cause. If H. pylori infection is present, antibiotics are used to eliminate the bacteria. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or H2 blockers may be prescribed to reduce stomach acid and allow the stomach lining to heal. A routine gastroscopy is recommended in one year for further changes in the stomach lining or early signs of complications, such as stomach cancer."
gastritis confirmed by biopsy,"위염, 조직검사에서도 위염","일부 위염이 심한 부위에서 시행한 조직검사 결과 염증소견 외 특별한 이상은 확인되지 않았습니다. 속쓰림, 소화 불량 등 증상이 있으시면 진료를 받으시고, 특별한 증상이 없으시면 정기검사를 받으시길 바랍니다.","Gastritis confirmed by biopsy means that a doctor has taken a small sample of your stomach lining and found that it has inflammation. This inflammation is characterized by the presence of cells that fight infection, which have infiltrated the layers of the stomach.","The common causes of gastritis include infections by Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that specifically affects the stomach. Other causes are the use of certain medications like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, severe stress from burns or trauma, and other bacterial or parasitic infections. Additionally, the consumption of very strong acids or alkaline substances can also cause gastritis.","Symptoms of gastritis can vary depending on whether it is acute or chronic. Acute gastritis typically causes sudden and severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Chronic gastritis might not present any symptoms initially, or it could cause ongoing indigestion, stomach pain, a feeling of fullness after only a small meal, abdominal bloating, nausea, and heartburn.","The treatment for gastritis usually starts with medications to reduce stomach acid, which helps relieve symptoms and heal the stomach lining. These medications include proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers. If a Helicobacter pylori infection is confirmed, a combination of antibiotics is prescribed to eradicate the bacteria. If there are no specific symptoms, you need to have a routine gastroscopy in two years."
endoscopy for the treatment or for follow-up of gastritis,위염이지만 치료 또는 추적 내시경,일부 위염이 심한 부위에서 시행한 조직검사 결과 염증소견 외 특별한 이상은 확인되지 않았습니다. 하지만 내시경적으로 관찰되는 위염의 정도가 심하여 치료 및 추적 내시경검사가 필요할 수 있으므로 의료기관을 방문하여 진료상담을 받으시길 바랍니다.,"When you have an endoscopy for the treatment or follow-up of gastritis, it means a doctor uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end to look inside your stomach. This procedure helps them see the lining of your stomach directly to assess inflammation, check for damage, and monitor any changes over time after treatment has begun.","The common causes of gastritis that might lead to this procedure include infections, particularly by the bacteria called Helicobacter pylori. Other causes include the long-term use of pain relievers like aspirin and NSAIDs, excessive alcohol consumption, severe stress from injuries or infections, and eating foods that lead to irritation like those that are overly spicy or acidic. Chronic smoking and bile reflux are also significant causes.","The symptoms of gastritis can vary but typically include sudden sharp pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting if it's acute gastritis. For chronic gastritis, the symptoms might be more subtle but can include ongoing indigestion, a feeling of fullness after eating small amounts, bloating, and a burning sensation in the stomach or lower chest, often described as heartburn.","The treatment for gastritis usually involves medications to reduce stomach acid and protect the stomach lining, such as proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers. If Helicobacter pylori is found, antibiotics are prescribed to eradicate the infection. Regular follow-up through endoscopy is crucial, especially if the gastritis is severe or chronic, to prevent complications like ulcers or, in some cases, to monitor for signs of gastric cancer. This ongoing monitoring is key to adjusting treatment as needed and ensuring the health of the stomach over time."
submucosal tumor,위 점막하종양,"위장조영검사 결과 점막하종양이 의심됩니다. 점막하종양이란 위점막 아래에서 발생한 종양을 말하며, 이 때문에 위벽 일부가 부풀어 올라온 것처럼 보입니다. 위내시경 검사를 통한 확인이 필요합니다. 빠른 시일 내에 의료기관을 방문하시어 진료 상담 후 위내시경 검사를 받으시길 바랍니다.","A submucosal tumor is a growth that forms underneath the inner lining of the stomach, called the mucosa. These tumors can develop in the deeper layers of the stomach wall and are not always cancerous. However, some submucosal tumors can be benign (non-cancerous), while others may become cancerous over time.","The causes of submucosal tumors vary depending on the type of tumor. Some of the most common types include gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), leiomyomas, and lipomas. The exact cause of these tumors isn't always known, but genetic mutations or abnormal cell growth can play a role in their development.","Symptoms of submucosal tumors can range from none at all to more noticeable signs as the tumor grows. Some people might experience stomach pain, discomfort, or a feeling of fullness after eating small amounts. If the tumor bleeds, there may be signs like vomiting blood or black stools.","Treatment for submucosal tumors depends on their size and whether they are cancerous. Small, benign tumors may not need immediate treatment but could be monitored through regular check-ups. If the tumor is large or potentially cancerous, surgery may be required to remove it. In some cases, additional therapies like targeted medications may be used, particularly if the tumor is a type like GIST."
gastric polyp,위폴립,위장조영검사 결과 위에 폴립이 관찰됩니다. 폴립은 점막 벽에서 혹처럼 튀어나와 자라난 것으로 위내시경검사를 통한 확인 및 조직검사가 필요합니다. 빠른 시일 내에 의료기관을 방문하시어 위내시경 검사를 받으시길 바랍니다.,"A gastric polyp is a small growth that forms on the inner lining of the stomach. Most gastric polyps are non-cancerous (benign), but some types may increase the risk of developing stomach cancer if left untreated. These polyps are usually found during endoscopy procedures done for other reasons.","The most common causes of gastric polyps include long-term inflammation of the stomach lining, such as in chronic gastritis, and the use of medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for acid reflux. Certain genetic conditions can also make people more prone to developing gastric polyps.","Many people with gastric polyps do not experience any symptoms. However, if the polyps grow large or become irritated, they can cause symptoms like stomach pain, nausea, or bleeding. In rare cases, polyps may block part of the stomach, leading to problems with digestion.","Treatment for gastric polyps depends on their size, type, and potential for becoming cancerous. Small polyps that are unlikely to turn into cancer might just be monitored with regular endoscopies. Larger polyps or those with a higher risk of cancer are usually removed during an endoscopy procedure. If there is an underlying cause like chronic gastritis, treating that condition can help prevent new polyps from forming."
benign gastric ulcer,양성 위궤양,위장조영검사 결과 위궤양이 의심됩니다. 위내시경검사를 통한 확진 및 치료가 필요합니다. 빠른 시일 내에 의료기관을 방문하시어 위내시경 검사를 받으시길 바랍니다.,"A benign gastric ulcer is a non-cancerous sore or lesion that forms on the lining of the stomach. Unlike malignant ulcers, these do not spread to other parts of the body and are generally less serious, although they still require treatment to prevent complications.","The common causes of benign gastric ulcers include infection with Helicobacter pylori, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen, excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and severe stress. These factors can weaken the stomach's protective mucous layer, allowing acid to cause damage to the stomach lining.","People with a benign gastric ulcer may experience symptoms such as a burning or gnawing pain in the middle or upper stomach between meals or at night. This pain might temporarily be relieved by eating or by taking antacids. Other symptoms can include bloating, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. In more severe cases, ulcers can lead to complications such as bleeding in the stomach, which might show up as vomiting blood or black, tarry stools.","The treatment for a benign gastric ulcer usually involves medication to reduce stomach acid, which helps relieve pain and encourages healing. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers are commonly prescribed to decrease acid production. If an infection with Helicobacter pylori is detected, a combination of antibiotics will be used to eradicate the bacteria. In cases where the ulcer is caused by NSAIDs, doctors will advise stopping or reducing the use of these drugs. For ulcers that cause severe bleeding, endoscopic procedures may be required to stop the bleeding, and in rare cases, surgery might be necessary if the ulcer has caused a perforation or severe bleeding that can't be controlled by other means. Regular follow-ups with a doctor are essential to monitor the ulcer and ensure it heals properly."
Gastritis with regenerative atypia,"위염, 조직검사상 재생이형성",일부 위염이 심한 부위에서 시행한 조직검사 결과 재생이형성이 있습니다. 재생이형성은 만성 염증과 재생과정에서 나타나는 세포변화이지만 추적관찰시 드물게 샘종이나 위샘암종으로 발견되는 경우도 있습니다. 의료기관을 방문하여 추적 내시경 검사에 대한 진료상담을 받으시길 바랍니다.,"Gastritis with regenerative atypia is a condition where the lining of your stomach is inflamed and the cells are showing abnormal changes. These changes are usually the stomach's response to chronic irritation and injury, as it tries to heal itself. However, this altered regeneration can sometimes lead to abnormal growths, such as adenomas or even adenocarcinomas, which are types of tumors.","The common causes of this type of gastritis include persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excessive alcohol consumption, and chronic bile reflux. Other factors like smoking and severe physical stress from illnesses or injuries can also contribute to the development of this condition.","Symptoms of gastritis with regenerative atypia can vary but often include a feeling of pain or burning in the upper abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of fullness after only a small meal. In some cases, the condition might not show noticeable symptoms but could still be progressing, which makes regular check-ups important.","The treatment for this type of gastritis typically involves medications that reduce stomach acid to alleviate symptoms and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors or H2 blockers are commonly prescribed. If Helicobacter pylori infection is detected, a combination of antibiotics will be used to eradicate the bacteria. Since regenerative atypia can sometimes progress to more serious conditions, regular endoscopic examinations are crucial. These help monitor the health of the gastric mucosa and detect any early signs of progression toward tumor development. Depending on the findings, more frequent monitoring or additional interventions, including possibly surgical options, might be recommended."

This is a clear indication that the protective lining of your stomach is swollen and irritated, which can disrupt your stomach's normal function.","The common causes of this type of gastritis include infection by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that specifically targets the stomach lining. Other factors contributing to this condition can be the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, severe stress, and sometimes the ingestion of strong acids or alkaline substances. These factors damage the stomach lining or weaken its ability to protect itself against the harsh gastric acid.","Symptoms of gastritis can vary from acute to chronic forms. Acutely, it might present with sudden, severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Chronic gastritis, on the other hand, may exhibit more subdued symptoms such as indigestion, a constant feeling of fullness after eating little food, bloating, mild nausea, and recurrent heartburn.","Gastric polyps with histological evidence of inflammation are typically benign and have a low association with cancer. While no specific treatment is usually required, it is important to schedule regular check-ups to monitor any potential changes."

Gastritis involves the swelling of the stomach's mucosa due to inflammatory cells, while a hyperplastic polyp is a non-cancerous bump that forms on the stomach lining, usually as a result of excessive growth of the stomach's mucosal cells.","The common causes of this diagnosis include Helicobacter pylori infection, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. Additionally, stress and dietary factors, such as spicy or highly acidic foods, can contribute to gastritis, while the exact cause of hyperplastic polyps is less clear but can be associated with chronic inflammation.","Symptoms of gastritis can include sharp or burning pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and indigestion. The discomfort often worsens with eating. Hyperplastic polyps, on the other hand, typically do not cause symptoms unless they are large enough to obstruct part of the stomach, which is rare.","As for the hyperplastic polyp, these are generally monitored rather than actively treated, because they rarely transform into cancer. However, regular endoscopic check-ups are recommended to monitor the polyp for any changes in size or appearance, and removal may be considered if there is significant growth or concern for potential complications."

This means that the polyp was taken out for testing and no longer remains in your stomach. Most gastric polyps are non-cancerous and don’t pose a significant threat, but removing them helps to ensure that they won't develop into something more serious, like cancer.","Gastric polyps can form due to long-term irritation of the stomach lining, often caused by chronic gastritis or the use of medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In some cases, genetic factors may also play a role.","Most people with gastric polyps don’t experience any noticeable symptoms. However, larger polyps can cause stomach pain, nausea, or bleeding, though this is less common.","During the endoscopy, a small polyp was observed and removed during the biopsy.

These polyps are generally non-cancerous (benign) and develop from the tissue of the stomach's inner surface. They protrude into the stomach cavity and, depending on their size and location, can cause various symptoms or remain symptomless.","The exact cause of gastric polyps is not fully understood, but they are often associated with chronic inflammation of the stomach lining, which can be due to factors like Helicobacter pylori infection, prolonged use of certain medications, bile reflux, or autoimmune responses that affect the stomach.","While many gastric polyps do not cause any symptoms and are discovered incidentally during examinations for other issues, a large polyp might cause symptoms. These can include nausea, vomiting, a sensation of early fullness while eating (due to the polyp occupying space within the stomach), and sometimes bleeding which can lead to anemia if the polyp is eroding into blood vessels.","Doctors typically recommend close monitoring with follow-up endoscopies to assess any changes in size or appearance. Based on these observations and biopsy results, a decision will be made whether surgical removal is necessary. This approach ensures careful evaluation before proceeding with more invasive treatments."

These changes are generally a response to ongoing inflammation and the body's attempt to repair the damaged gastric mucosa. While this condition is often benign, the atypical cell regeneration could pose a risk for developing into more serious conditions such as adenomas or gastric cancer if left unchecked.","The common causes of gastric polyps include chronic inflammation often related to Helicobacter pylori infection, long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), bile reflux, or autoimmune disorders that affect the stomach lining. These factors can lead to changes in the stomach's environment, prompting the mucosa to form polyps.","Many individuals with gastric polyps do not experience any symptoms, especially when the polyps are small. However, larger polyps or those located near the pylorus might cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, intermittent gastric outlet obstruction, or even chronic bleeding leading to anemia. These symptoms arise from the polyp interfering with the normal function of the stomach and possibly obstructing the gastric outlet.","The treatment for gastric polyps generally involves endoscopic removal, particularly when the polyps are large or show signs of regenerative atypia. This procedure, known as endoscopic polypectomy, is minimally invasive and involves using a specialized instrument to remove the polyp during an endoscopy. This method allows for both the treatment of the polyp and the acquisition of tissue for further histological examination to assess the extent of cellular atypia and rule out cancerous transformation."

In your case, the biopsy revealed that it is an adenoma, which is a type of polyp that has the potential to become cancerous over time. The presence of ""low-grade dysplasia"" means that some of the cells in the polyp have started to look abnormal but are not yet cancerous. This is an early-stage change, which means the risk of developing cancer is present, but it is still low.","The most common causes of adenomatous gastric polyps with dysplasia include chronic inflammation of the stomach, such as from Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or long-term use of certain medications like proton pump inhibitors. These factors can lead to changes in the stomach lining over time, increasing the risk of abnormal cell growth.","Many people with gastric polyps, including adenomas, don’t have symptoms. If symptoms occur, they may include stomach pain, nausea, or bleeding, but these are usually only seen with larger polyps.","The primary approach for an adenoma with low-grade dysplasia involves either endoscopic removal of the polyp or close monitoring with follow-up consultations. Immediate surgery is not always necessary. Instead, a decision is made based on further evaluation, which may include additional endoscopies to track any changes in the polyp or stomach lining. If needed, future polyps can be removed to prevent progression to more severe dysplasia or cancer."
"gastric polyp, Bx adenoma with high grade dysplasia","위폴립, 조직검사상 고도샘종",위내시경검사에서 위폴립이 관찰됩니다. 위폴립은 점막 벽에서 혹처럼 튀어나와 자라난 것으로 조직검사에서 고도샘종으로 확인되었습니다. 고도샘종은 암으로 변할 가능성이 높습니다. 빠른 시일 내에 의료기관을 방문하여 치료에 대한 진료 상담을 받으시기 바랍니다.,A gastric polyp diagnosed as an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia means that you have a growth on your stomach lining that contains cells with significant abnormalities. High-grade dysplasia is a more serious condition where the cells in the polyp are more abnormal and have a higher chance of turning into cancer if not treated.,"Common causes of adenomas with high-grade dysplasia include long-term irritation or inflammation of the stomach lining, often from infections like Helicobacter pylori or from prolonged use of medications such as proton pump inhibitors. These factors can lead to changes in the stomach lining that increase the risk of developing abnormal cells.","People with this diagnosis might not always have symptoms, but if they do, they could experience stomach pain, nausea, or bleeding. In some cases, the polyp could cause other issues like difficulty eating or digestion problems.","Treatment usually involves removing the polyp, which is often done during an endoscopy. Because high-grade dysplasia indicates a higher risk of cancer, it’s important to remove the polyp to prevent progression to cancer. After removal, your doctor will likely recommend regular follow-up endoscopies to monitor the stomach lining and check for any new or recurring abnormalities. If cancer is suspected or detected, additional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation may be required."
gastric cancer,위암,위내시경 및 조직검사에서 위암이 확인되었습니다. 치료를 위해 빠른 시일 내에 의료기관을 방문하시어 진료 상담을 받으시기 바랍니다.,"Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, occurs when cells in the lining of the stomach grow uncontrollably and form a tumor. Over time, this cancer can spread to other parts of the body if not treated early.","The main causes of gastric cancer include long-term infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacteria, chronic inflammation of the stomach, and a diet high in salty, smoked, or processed foods. Smoking and a family history of gastric cancer can also increase the risk.","Symptoms of gastric cancer often develop slowly and may include stomach pain, indigestion, bloating, nausea, and loss of appetite. In more advanced cases, people may experience weight loss, difficulty swallowing, vomiting blood, or black stools.","Treatment for gastric cancer depends on the stage of the disease. It may involve surgery to remove part or all of the stomach, chemotherapy to shrink or kill cancer cells, and radiation therapy to target cancerous areas. Targeted therapies or immunotherapy may also be used in some cases to attack specific cancer cells."
small gastric submucosal tumor,크기가 작은 위점막하종양,"위내시경검사에서 위에 작은 점막하종양이 있습니다. 점막하종양이란 위점막 아래에서 발생한 종양을 말하며, 이 때문에 위벽 일부가 부풀어 올라온것처럼 보입니다. 작은 점막하종양은 당장 특별한 치료가 필요하지는 않지만, 크기 변화를 살펴보기 위해 정기적인 추적검사가 필요합니다. 의료기관을 방문하시어 진료 상담을 받으시기 바랍니다.","A small gastric subepithelial tumor refers to a growth that forms beneath the top layer of tissue lining the stomach. This type of tumor is embedded in the layers under the stomach’s surface, which may include the connective tissue or muscle layers. These tumors are often benign, meaning they are not cancerous, but careful monitoring and diagnosis are crucial to ensure they do not pose a more serious risk.","The exact causes of subepithelial tumors in the stomach are not well understood. They could be related to genetic factors, environmental influences, or could arise spontaneously without a clear cause. Factors that could potentially contribute to their development include chronic irritation or inflammation within the stomach lining.","Most small subepithelial tumors do not cause any symptoms, especially when they are small. They are typically discovered incidentally during endoscopic examinations for other reasons. However, if a tumor grows larger, it might cause symptoms such as discomfort or pain in the stomach area, feelings of fullness, or gastrointestinal bleeding if the tumor affects the stomach lining significantly.","The treatment of a small gastric subepithelial tumor often involves careful monitoring through regular endoscopic check-ups to watch for changes in size or behavior of the tumor. If the tumor is small and shows no signs of growth or malignancy, immediate treatment may not be necessary. For tumors that show potential risks, such as those that are growing or symptomatic, surgical resection might be considered. Endoscopic techniques have advanced to allow the removal of some subepithelial tumors without the need for open surgery, making the procedure less invasive. The decision to remove a tumor endoscopically depends on its size, location, and the potential risk it poses, and should be guided by a detailed examination and biopsy to determine its nature."
big gastric submucosal tumor,크기가 큰 위점막하종양,"위내시경검사에서 위에 점막하종양이 있습니다. 점막하종양이란 위점막 아래에서 발생한 종양을 말하며, 이 때문에 위벽 일부가 부풀어 올라온 것처럼 보입니다. 점막하 종양은 종류에 따라 아무런 치료가 필요하지 않는 경우부터 수술적 절제가 필요한 경우까지 치료방법이 매우 다양합니다. 정확한 진단 및 적절한 치료 방침 결정을 위해 의료기관을 방문하시어 진료 상담을 받으시길 바랍니다.","A diagnosis of a ""big gastric subepithelial tumor"" refers to a large growth located beneath the innermost layer of the stomach's lining. Unlike tumors that develop on the surface, subepithelial tumors grow under the lining of the stomach, which can make them harder to detect early.","The exact causes of gastric subepithelial tumors are not well understood. They might develop due to abnormal growth of tissue within the muscular or connective layers beneath the gastric mucosa, which can be triggered by various factors, including genetic mutations or unknown environmental influences.","Symptoms of a large gastric subepithelial tumor can vary depending on its size and location. Small tumors often do not cause any symptoms and are discovered incidentally during procedures for other reasons. However, larger tumors may cause symptoms such as pain or discomfort in the stomach, feelings of fullness after eating only small amounts of food, nausea, or vomiting. In some cases, if the tumor grows large enough to disrupt the stomach's function, it can cause bleeding which may present as vomiting blood or black stools.","The treatment for a gastric subepithelial tumor largely depends on its size, the symptoms it causes, and whether it shows signs of malignancy. For small, non-symptomatic tumors that show no signs of cancer, monitoring with regular endoscopic exams may be sufficient. For larger or symptomatic tumors, or if a biopsy indicates potential malignancy, surgical removal is typically recommended. This can often be performed endoscopically in a minimally invasive procedure known as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), which allows for the tumor to be removed without the need for extensive surgery. In more complex cases where the tumor is too large or has penetrated deeper layers, more traditional surgery might be required. After removal, regular follow-up is necessary to monitor for recurrence or any new growth."

This ulcer is associated with an infection by Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterium that specifically targets the stomach lining.","The most common cause of this type of gastric ulcer is an infection with Helicobacter pylori. This bacterium weakens the stomach's protective mucous layer, allowing digestive juices to irritate and damage the stomach tissues. Other contributing factors can include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excessive alcohol consumption, smoking, and severe stress, all of which can exacerbate the condition and impair healing.","Symptoms of a gastric ulcer typically include a burning or gnawing pain in the middle or upper part of the stomach, especially when the stomach is empty. This pain often occurs a few hours after eating and might improve after taking antacids or food. Other possible symptoms include bloating, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and in more severe cases, vomiting of blood or passing black, tarry stools, which indicates bleeding.","Treatment for your condition will likely focus on eradicating the Helicobacter pylori infection to prevent further damage to the stomach lining. This is usually achieved through a combination therapy of antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid and allow the ulcer to heal. In addition to this, your doctor may recommend avoiding NSAIDs, reducing stress, quitting smoking, and limiting alcohol intake to help manage your symptoms and prevent recurrence. Regular follow-up endoscopies might be necessary to monitor the ulcer’s healing and ensure that the infection has been fully cleared."
